# Metrics-for-explainability
# Sauer Soria Pablo Daniel

This repository contains source code necessary to produce results of the use of 2 metrics: "Deletion" and "Insertion" from Xplique
https://github.com/eclique/RISE

To use this code you have to download the files in it and run Evaluations.ipynb in Colab where you have to load all the .py this files.
In the case you want to use only tree images just load goldfish.jpg and turtle.jpg.
But if you want to use the hundred images, in Evaluations.ipynb you have to uncomment the first use of the parameter 'img_list' and comment the second use of it.
